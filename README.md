# A Wedding Website
You should probably just use Zola or something, this probably isn't really worth it for a wedding website.


## Where I Started
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/rampatra/wedding-website.git` - clone this project to your computer
2. `$ cd wedding-website` - go inside the project directory
3. `$ npm install` - install dependencies
4. `$ gulp` - compile sass to css, minify js, etc.
5. That's it, open `index.html` file on your browser by just double-clicking on it.
6. Regret using this template, but it's too late now.
7. Accept your fate.
